So, updating my school website has actually become a bit more complicated. But all in the interest of becoming easier. I think.

The website content is all kept in ~/Dropbox/website/web_source ($WEB_SOURCE for this document)

First, my personal wiki should be downloaded as a static copy into
$WEB_SOURCE/wiki/
Well, first delete the existing contents.
This can be done by navigating to that directory (wiki, that is), and then running download_strip.sh there.
NOTE: Should likely turn off Dropbox syncing first!

Now that the website source is ready to go, it's time to generate the website.
This can be done by going to ~/research/gen-site/ and running
make clean
make

!!!! Acad is going away. !!!!
Tar, and upload to acad:
tar cvf website.tar ./generated/
scp website.tar jcmarsh@acad.gwu.edu:~/

Login to acad, delete the old public_html, unpack the website there, and run the fix html script.

ssh jcmarsh@acad.gwu.edu
cd public_html; mv ../website.tar ./; tar -xvf website.tar; mv ./generated/* ./; rm -r generated
fix_html
