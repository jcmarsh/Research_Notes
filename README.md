Research_Notes
==============

notes.org Has my notes for work on composite 64 bit conversion.

c_test has a few miscellaneous programs used to test out various things in c (call conventions, sizeof, etc.)

asm_test is similar, but is all assembly code.

grid_draw is a python program to draw (you guessed it) grids for use in Player Stage.

Some test code my depend on Composite code, so will not work here.
