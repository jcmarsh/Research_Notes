To convert to an image, run something like this:

dot -Tpdf plan.dot -o plan.pdf

or

dot -Tsvg plan.dot -o plan.svg

To get it into a google drive document (such as a slide show), you can either output is a bitmap format such as .png.
This will make the text look fuzzy as it is resized.

The better option is to output as a .svg.
Then use CloudConvert to make it into a .emf.
Google Drawings can then be used to open the .emf, and you can just highlight / copy / paste from there into the slideshow.

Simple, right?
