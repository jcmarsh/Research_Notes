** timer_test
It looks like timers do not fire immediately (or on timer) when a system has high utilization. I need to test this to rule out other problems.
** signal_test
Timers notify the process of expiration via signals (timerfd is likely built on signals too, just hidden). So if timers aren't working under load, there is a good chance that neither are signals. Need to test this.
